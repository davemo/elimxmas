      We are thrilled to have you visit us in <em>new surroundings</em>. Many of you visited us in our old location on 8th Street. That building was sold and we moved into this church at <a href="#map"><em>419 Slimmon Road</em></a> in April, 2012. This is only our second Christmas here.

      The facility is comfortable, bright and spacious and the sound system is state-of-the-art. Come early and enjoy some refreshments at <em>Caf√© Oasis</em> and take a family or group photo in front of the huge Christmas tree in the Atrium.
